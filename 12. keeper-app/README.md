# React.js
React is a `JavaScript library` for building `user interfaces`. It is a `front end` framework. It makes it easy to create repetitive elements. You can break down a very complex user interface structure into a `component tree`, with each of the component `reusable` and `customizable`. It also vastly simplifies the structure of your website. 

It is effectively like creating your own custom HTML elements. React combines a small amount of html, css and javascript together in to a single component so that each component has its own styling, functionality. We can also have component `listening` for changes in the server and updating itself and its own appearance and data, and talk to the server independently. 

React is also able to render changes effectively  because it compares changes, and makes your app more interactive and much faster.
